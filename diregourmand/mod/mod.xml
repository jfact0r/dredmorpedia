<!-- Questions:

Will this be enough Magic Resist to help melee characters with their high mortality rate? I don't actually understand the precise mechanics of Magic Resist!
!-->

<!-- Notes:

This skill is about being a slightly hedonistic gourmand (with a splash of Weird Science) - you love to eat and drink, but you don't necessarily seek the fanciest of foods. It is closer in philosophy to Epicureanism than Cyrenaics.

This skill is designed to make melee characters slightly less prone to dying.

This skill is designed to work well with Werediggles.

This skill is designed to provide an otherwise pure Warrior build with the ability to generate sufficient mana for full usage of Viking Wizardry, Psionics, or other splash Wizard skill.

This skill is designed to sneak Magic Resist into a pure Warrior build via Stubbornness.

This skill is intentionally spikier than Berserking, so that you can have more Fun when the RNG hates you, and so that the buffs can be more appreciable in size.
